A repository with songs styled by me, LightArrowsEXE, either for fun or for releases.

You're free to grab those subtitles and use them for your own release. However, I would like to request you to give credit where credit is due when releasing. Likewise, if you distribute these in other places, make sure to include the [license file](./LICENSE) as well.

In every directory I will be including information on what templaters were used, screenshots to show the styling and/or effects, as well as where I got the styling inspiration, lyrics, etc. from.
